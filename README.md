# RSMambaReg
RSMambaReg: Continual Learning on Remote Sensing Image Classification with State Space Model and Elastic Weight Consolidation

# Abstract
Will be posted after paper published.

# Proposed Architecture
The process framework for continual learning adopted in this study demonstrates the step-by-step methodology applied to sequential datasets.
